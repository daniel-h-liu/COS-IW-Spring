INCLUDED ON WEBSITE:
- A program is defined as one or more performances or presentations in 
which the same repertoire, conductors, and soloists are EXACTLY the same
(dates, times, locations may vary within). For example, if a soloist 
plays an encore one night but not another, the concert with the encore 
becomes a different program.
- Movements are now included as cataloged by NYP. Keep in mind that we 
do not necessarily catalog every movement in the work, only movements 
that we have ever performed.
- To see detailed information about our internal descriptive standards,

PERSONAL  NOTES: 
- INTERMISSION is listed as a work in every concert, with id 0*,
    interval "INTERMISSION", and no composerName, noWorkTitle,
    conductorName, and an empty list of soloists
- It seems sometimes works are included separately by movements, and
    other times together as one piece. This would result in HUGE
    discrepancies in trends if true.
    - The * after the work id seems to refer to the movement number.
- Sometimes a worktitle is not a single string but a whole dictionary??
    - First "_" refers to usually the specific movement name, with any
        arrangers listed.
    - "em" is where the movement is from. But why different system than
        just having the "movement" feature like other works do? Maybe
        because this is a specific movement arranged from a piece--
        the entire piece is not arranged by the group and then one
        movement is selected from that larger work.

- Dates of concerts are in ISO8601? But giving wrong time (AM instead of PM)
- Composer name
    - Wrong entry of Carl Maria von Weber, sometimes Carl Maria Von Weber
        - Now merged together through OpenRefine
    - Sometimes Matos Rodriguez, Gerardo, othertimes Rodriguez, Gerardo Matos
        - Now merged together through OpenRefine
    - WHO IS ACT,?? appears once in Michael Tilson Thomas concert. Is it 
        act of an opera? But it isn't an opera concert...
    - Unknown vs. Unspecified. I am making the decision that semantically,
        it is not that crucial of a difference so I will change them 
        all to be "Unknown,". *This is not the same as blank.*
- Many pieces' names incorrect
    - SYMPHONY NO. 3 vs. SYMPHONY NO.  3
    - PIANO SONATA, OP. 1 vs. SONATA, PIANO, OP. 1
- There are SONGS (UNSPECIFIED) and WORKS (UNSPECIFIED)...
    - Leaving them there for now. Fixed issue of placement of parantheses
        in OpenRefine.
- Things like String Quartet are assumed to be 2 Violin, Cello, and Viola
    while Trios and other arrangements are specified TRIO, INSTRUMENT1,
    INSTRUMENT2, etc.
- concerts is a list: are there times when there are multiple concerts
    that are stored under the same programID? How does this effect 
    counting the concerts--keep it 1, or multiply it by len(concerts)?
- Concert location
    - Spartanburg, NC is not real. Spartanburg, SC is.
- Conductor
    - Alberto Sciarretti incorrectly listed as Alberto Sciaretti
    - Random semicolons in front of conductor names at times
    - Where there are multiple conductors, they are split by semicolon,
        must account for this while coding and counting. Conductors
        should be kept as a list then. Won't be the easiest to retrieve,
        but possible and not the most critical information anyways.
    - Some are not conducted, especially chamber-esque pieces. However
        sometimes it says "Not conducted", and other times it is blank.
        Not possible to change all to not conducted (would change all
        the rows in OpenRefine, even ones not associated with pieces).
        Will have to handle in code (change to "Not conducted" if blank)
- Ran text facets on pieces, composers, location, venue, eventType, 
    conductor 
- TODO: Currently, wagner and dis meistersinger, tannhauser, etc. are all
    at the top of the count. Most likely, these are being overcounted 
    due to separate movements. VERIFY, AND TRY TO FIX!!
