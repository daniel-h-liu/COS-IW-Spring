INCLUDED ON WEBSITE:
- A program is defined as one or more performances or presentations in 
which the same repertoire, conductors, and soloists are EXACTLY the same
(dates, times, locations may vary within). For example, if a soloist 
plays an encore one night but not another, the concert with the encore 
becomes a different program.
- Movements are now included as cataloged by NYP. Keep in mind that we 
do not necessarily catalog every movement in the work, only movements 
that we have ever performed.
- To see detailed information about our internal descriptive standards,

PERSONAL  NOTES: 
- INTERMISSION is listed as a work in every concert, with id 0*,
    interval "INTERMISSION", and no composerName, noWorkTitle,
    conductorName, and an empty list of soloists
- It seems sometimes works are included separately by movements, and
    other times together as one piece. This would result in HUGE
    discrepancies in trends if true.
    - The * after the work id seems to refer to the movement number.
- Sometimes a worktitle is not a single string but a whole dictionary??
    - First "_" refers to usually the specific movement name, with any
        arrangers listed.
    - "em" is where the movement is from. But why different system than
        just having the "movement" feature like other works do? Maybe
        because this is a specific movement arranged from a piece--
        the entire piece is not arranged by the group and then one
        movement is selected from that larger work.
